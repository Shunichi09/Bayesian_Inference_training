# Mixture Model
Generally speaking, the model distribution which can express the real world things is not so simple.
Therefore, as extending model of simple model, the mixtured model were proposed.

# Problem Formulation
By excuting this progoram you can see how the mixtured model used for classification problem.
You can see following models

- Poisson

- Gauss

# Usage

```
$ python poisson.py
```

# Expected Results

- Poisson
